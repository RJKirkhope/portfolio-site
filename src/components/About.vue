    <h1>About me.</h1>
    <p class="paragraph"> I have worked lots of jobs in many industries, and while most of them provide me with the stressful, hectic whirlwind I thrive in, the vast majority havenâ€™t allowed me to embrace my creative nature. Becoming a full stack developer offers me an opportunity to work in an industry that is all about creative thinking and adapting to new challenges and technologies. I have recently completed the Galvanize web development program, and plan to take what I learned there and use it as a foundation for shaping myself into a skilled, knowledgeable developer. In the coming months I will be on the hunt for a job in the greater Denver metro to meet your needs for front and/or back end development. When I am not coding, I enjoy rock and ice climbing, dual sport motorcycling, and Dungeons and Dragons. Please feel free to check out some of my recent projects. </p>
